# FYP-BabyNeuron-Unity
### This repository contains an implementation for 2 games (2D and 3D) of the same concept. 
## Intro
The purpose behind this R&D project is to evaluate the difference in cognitive gain by playing cognition targetting 2D and 3D games. There are many widespread researches focusing on cognition enhancement using Serious 2D Games, there are some on 3D as well. Our research however, focuses on the gap between the gain of these two types. Therefore, we have implemented a cognition boosting concept using gamification elements into a serious game with 2D and 3D versions 
## Card Flip 2D
#### It contains a starting menu for registeration and login for the children to be experimented on.
#### The screen after login shows the option to enter a Corsi Block Tapping test (see [Psy Tool Kit](https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_corsi.html)) if not already entered for a specific user (mostly first timers). It then takes the user to a main menu for the 2D game which contains a Jungle like 2D scenery (assets picked from the Unity Assets Store).
### Main Menu
From the Main Menu the user can either Play or Exit. The Play button takes the user to the Levels screen where 10 levels are defined so far. The Exit button takes the user to a screen with a post game Corsi Block test evaluation
### Levels
From the levels screen, user can choose out of 10 levels to play the game. These are in an increasing level of difficulty with
- Increase in number of pairs
- Increase in card randomness
####
Once a user selects a level, they are delivered to the Game Screen
### Game Screen
In the game, the cards spawn according to the level number. The cards are clickable and when two cards match they disappear, if they do not match - they flip back
## Card Flip 3D
#### It contains a starting menu and Pre Corsi screen exactly the same as the 2D
### Main Menu
The user in 3D main menu can roam around in the emersive environment of the assets added. The environment is made to look real and dynamic. The Play and Exit buttons are floating in the air and can be accessed from anywhere in the scene.
### Levels
The levels screen contains the same environment from a perspective view. The level numbers are placed on top of cubes to give an emphasis on 3D and the use of proximity of objects is made as apparent as possible
### Game Screen
In the 3D game, the cards are cubiods with the characters on it in 3D shapes. They have skin, textures and animations to make them appear protruding out of the cubes when the cube is flipped
